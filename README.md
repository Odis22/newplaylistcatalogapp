# newplaylistcatalogapp
this app is in infancy stages, but there are still stuff i would like to add soon. 


SYNOPSIS

I developed an application that provides a list of songs according to people's moods as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

Motivation

learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication and use the CRUD method INSTALLATION

Install Vagrant and VirtualBox Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up) Write your Flask application locally in the playlist1 directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
1. you set up the database by running database_setup.py
2. you then run playlistsongs.py
3. then you start the app by running app.py
Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:5000 locally
